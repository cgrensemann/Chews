It's chess but from us and awesome. 

## Preparing your IDE (Eclipse)
Currently we are using JavaSE-11, make sure you have a JDK installed that supports this (at least 11).
To work with the code given in this repository you need to add JavaFX 14 from openjfx.io as a User Library and call it "JavaFX14".
You can find a tutorial on how to do that at https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#IDE-Eclipse - don't forget to add the VM arguments!
